"},"index.html":{"id":"index.html","title":"Index","body":" minicharts Reference BarchartPiechartPolarchart minicharts.js: easily add mini animated chartsminicharts.js is a javascript library to add easily compact animated charts in an html page. This can be especially usefull when you want to include many similar charts in a limited space like a table, a map or a complex chart. The full documentation is available here. You can also test the library on JsFiddle. UsageFirst include the script in your html pages: &lt;script src=&quot;https://unpkg.com/minicharts@0.1.1/dist/minicharts.min.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;This adds a global object called minicharts. Alternatively you can install the library with npm and use it with: var minicharts = require(minicharts);Next add to your html an element that will contain the chart and that can be easily selected with a CSS selector. For instance: &lt;span id=&quot;mychart&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;In your javascript, create the desired chart: var mychart = new minicharts.Barchart(&quot;#mychart&quot;, [1, 2, 3]); Customize your chartsFor now three chart types are available: Barchart, Piechart and Polarchart. Their constructor take the same parameters: A CSS selector An array containing values to represent An optional object containing graphical options for your chart like width, height, colors, etc. Here is an example: var opts = { colors: [&quot;#2B303A&quot;, &quot;#92DCE5&quot;, &quot;#EEE5E9&quot;], width:100, labels: &quot;auto&quot;, maxValue: 3 // Important if you want to compare charts }; var mychart = new minicharts.Polarchart(&quot;#mychart&quot;, [1, 2, 3], opts); Update a chartCharts object have methods setData and setOptions to update respectively data and graphical options. Here is the code use to generate the example at the top of the document: var opts = { width:360, height:120, labels: &quot;auto&quot;, maxValue: 100 }; function fakeData(n) { var res = []; for (var i = 0; i &lt; n; i++) res.push(Math.random() * 100); return res; } var mychart = new minicharts.Barchart(&quot;#mychart&quot;, fakeData(6), opts); setInterval(function(){mychart.setData(fakeData(6))}, 1000);Contributing:Contributions to the library are welcome and can be submitted in the form of pull requests to this repository.

"},"Polarchart.html":{"id":"Polarchart.html","title":"Polarchart","body":" minicharts Reference BarchartPiechartPolarchart Polarchart Represent data with a polar chart Polar charts are nice looking charts especially on a map, but individual values are hard to compare on these charts: the human eye is good to compare lengths, but not to compare agnles, radius or areas. Polar charts should only be used when one wants to point out qualitative results and does not need a precise representation of data.
